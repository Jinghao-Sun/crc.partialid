Description:  we apply the theory of partial identification to show that weak assump- tions or qualitative knowledge about the nature of dependence between samples can be used to characterize a non-trivial set in which the true population size lies with high probability. We construct confidence sets for the population size under bounds on pairwise capture probabilities, and bounds on the highest order interaction term in a log-linear model using two methods: test inversion bootstrap confidence intervals, and profile likelihood confidence intervals.
